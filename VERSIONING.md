# Semantic Versioning Guidelines

Performance Management System follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) principles.

## 📋 Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

### MAJOR Version (X.0.0)
**Increment when making incompatible API changes or breaking changes**

Examples:
- Database schema changes requiring data migration
- Removing or significantly changing API endpoints
- Changing authentication mechanisms
- Removing features or changing user workflows
- NextAuth version upgrades that break compatibility

**Current**: v2.x.x

### MINOR Version (1.X.0)
**Increment when adding functionality in a backward compatible manner**

Examples:
- New evaluation features (e.g., peer reviews, 360 feedback)
- New export formats or reporting capabilities
- Additional authentication methods (e.g., SSO integration)
- New admin dashboard features
- Performance cycle enhancements
- New user roles or permissions

**Guidelines**:
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- New features should be opt-in when possible
- Database changes must be additive only

### PATCH Version (1.0.X)
**Increment for backward compatible bug fixes and security patches**

Examples:
- Security vulnerability fixes
- Bug fixes in evaluation workflows
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation updates
- UI/UX improvements that don't change functionality
- Dependency updates (without breaking changes)
