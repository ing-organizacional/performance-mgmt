# CLAUDE.md

This file provides critical guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) for this repository.

## Project Overview

Performance Management System - Enterprise web application managing employee
evaluations across 4000+ employees in 27 companies. **Hybrid design system**:
Desktop-first dashboards + Mobile-first applications with comprehensive
bilingual support (English/Spanish). **Now featuring enterprise-grade

**Proven Performance**: SQLite architecture confidently handles **up to 10,000
employees** per installation with sub-50ms query performance. CSV imports
support **2,500+ users** per batch. Multi-tenant architecture scales to
**25,000 total employees** across companies.
