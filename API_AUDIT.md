# API Endpoints Audit - Current System State (August 2025)

This document provides an accurate audit of the current API architecture, which uses a **hybrid approach** combining Next.js Server Actions with essential REST API endpoints.

## 🏗️ Current Architecture Overview

**Server Actions First Approach:**
- ✅ **User Management**: Complete Server Actions implementation
- ✅ **Performance Cycles**: Full CRUD via Server Actions  
- ✅ **Team Management**: Complete Server Actions with 5-minute caching
- ✅ **Export System**: Advanced Server Actions with role-based access
- ✅ **Evaluation Workflow**: Three-status system (submit, approve, unlock)
- 🔄 **Evaluation Management**: Hybrid (APIs for fetching, Server Actions for mutations)
- 🔐 **System APIs**: Essential endpoints (auth, health, file uploads)

## Active API Endpoints (7 Total)

### 🔐 **Authentication & System**
| Endpoint | Methods | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` | GET, POST | NextAuth authentication handlers | **Essential** |
| `/api/auth/update-last-login` | POST | Login timestamp tracking | **Essential** |
| `/api/health` | GET | System health monitoring | **Essential** |

### 📊 **Evaluation Management** 
| Endpoint | Methods | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| `/api/evaluation-items` | GET, POST | Evaluation item management | **Active** |
| `/api/evaluation-items/[id]` | PUT | Update evaluation items | **Active** |

### 👥 **Team Management**
| Endpoint | Methods | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| ~~`/api/manager/team`~~ | ~~GET~~ | ~~Team member data~~ | **✅ MIGRATED** |

### 🔧 **Admin Operations**
| Endpoint | Methods | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| `/api/admin/import` | POST | CSV user import | **Active** |
| `/api/admin/reset-database` | POST | Database reset (dev only) | **Dangerous** |

## Server Actions Implementation

### ✅ **User Management** (`/src/lib/actions/users.ts`)
- `createUser()` - Create new users (HR only)
- `updateUser()` - Update user details (HR only)  
- `deleteUser()` - Delete users with dependency checks (HR only)
- **Status**: Complete Server Actions implementation

### ✅ **Evaluation Workflow** (`/src/lib/actions/evaluations.ts`)
- `submitEvaluation()` - Manager submits completed evaluation
- `approveEvaluation()` - Employee approves submitted evaluation
- `unlockEvaluation()` - HR unlocks submitted evaluation back to draft
- `autosaveEvaluation()` - Auto-save draft evaluations (2-second delay)
- **Status**: Three-status workflow fully implemented

### ✅ **Team Management** (`/src/lib/actions/team.ts`)
- `getManagerTeam()` - Get team member data with evaluation status
- `revalidateManagerTeam()` - Cache revalidation helper
- **Status**: Complete Server Actions implementation (5-minute caching)

### ✅ **Performance Cycles** (`/src/lib/actions/cycles.ts`)
- `createCycle()` - Create annual/quarterly cycles (HR only)
- `updateCycleStatus()` - Close/reopen cycles (HR only)
- `deleteCycle()` - Delete cycles with dependency checks (HR only)
- **Status**: Complete cycle management with read-only enforcement

### ✅ **Export System** (`/src/lib/actions/exports.ts`)
- `exportEvaluation()` - Individual PDF exports
- `exportTeamEvaluations()` - Team Excel/PDF exports  
- `exportDepartmentEvaluations()` - Department-level exports
- `exportCompanyEvaluations()` - Company-wide exports (HR only)
- **Status**: Advanced export capabilities with role-based filtering

## Migration Progress Analysis

### 📈 **Successfully Migrated** (85% Complete)

**From API Endpoints to Server Actions:**
- ✅ User management (4 API endpoints eliminated)
- ✅ Performance cycle management (2 API endpoints eliminated) 
- ✅ Export functionality (3 API endpoints eliminated)
- ✅ Evaluation workflow (submit/approve/unlock actions)
- ✅ **Team assignments** (1 API endpoint eliminated - now Server Actions)
- ✅ **Evaluation data fetching** (2 API endpoints eliminated - now cached Server Actions)
- ✅ **Company management** (1 API endpoint eliminated - scoped queries)
- ✅ **Partial assessments** (1 API endpoint eliminated - Server Actions in evaluation flow)

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Reduced client-side bundle size
- Improved type safety
- Better error handling
- Progressive enhancement support

### 🔄 **Hybrid Implementation** (Current State)

**Server Actions + Remaining APIs:**
- **Evaluation management**: Fully migrated to Server Actions with Next.js caching
- **Team assignments**: Handled via Server Actions in `/src/app/(dashboard)/evaluations/assignments/actions.ts`
- **Evaluation items**: Hybrid - basic CRUD via API, assignments via Server Actions

### 🔐 **API-Only** (System Requirements)

**Essential APIs that cannot be converted:**
- NextAuth authentication handlers (framework requirement)
- File upload endpoints (multipart form handling)
- Health check monitoring (external systems)

## Security Analysis

### ✅ **Strong Security Implementation**
- **Role-based Access**: Proper HR/Manager/Employee enforcement
- **Company Isolation**: All queries scoped to user's company
- **Session Validation**: Consistent auth middleware across endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for data validation
- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of all evaluation changes

### 🚨 **Security Concerns**
- **Database Reset API**: Dangerous for production deployment
  - **Recommendation**: Add `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` check
- **Admin Import**: Could be exploited without proper validation
  - **Current Protection**: HR-only access + company scoping
