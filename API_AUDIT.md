## Migration Progress Analysis

### 📈 **Successfully Migrated** (95% Complete)

**From API Endpoints to Server Actions:**
- ✅ User management (4 API endpoints eliminated)
- ✅ Performance cycle management (2 API endpoints eliminated) 
- ✅ Export functionality (3 API endpoints eliminated)
- ✅ Evaluation workflow (submit/approve/unlock actions)
- ✅ **Team assignments** (1 API endpoint eliminated - now Server Actions)
- ✅ **Evaluation data fetching** (2 API endpoints eliminated - now cached Server Actions)
- ✅ **Company management** (1 API endpoint eliminated - scoped queries)
- ✅ **Partial assessments** (1 API endpoint eliminated - Server Actions in evaluation flow)
- ✅ **Admin operations** (2 API endpoints eliminated - CSV import and database reset)
- ✅ **Component architecture** (Major refactoring: 2,932 lines → 527 lines in key components)

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Reduced client-side bundle size
- Improved type safety
- Better error handling
- Progressive enhancement support

### 🔄 **Hybrid Implementation** (Current State)

**Server Actions + Remaining APIs:**
- **Evaluation management**: Fully migrated to Server Actions with Next.js caching
- **Team assignments**: Handled via Server Actions in `/src/app/(dashboard)/evaluations/assignments/actions.ts`
- **Evaluation items**: Hybrid - basic CRUD via API, assignments via Server Actions

### 🔐 **API-Only** (System Requirements)

**Essential APIs that cannot be converted:**
- NextAuth authentication handlers (framework requirement)
- File upload endpoints (multipart form handling)
- Health check monitoring (external systems)

## Security Analysis

### ✅ **Strong Security Implementation**
- **Role-based Access**: Proper HR/Manager/Employee enforcement
- **Company Isolation**: All queries scoped to user's company
- **Session Validation**: Consistent auth middleware across endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for data validation
- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of all evaluation changes

### 🚨 **Security Concerns**
- **Database Reset API**: Dangerous for production deployment
  - **Recommendation**: Add `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` check
- **Admin Import**: Could be exploited without proper validation
  - **Current Protection**: HR-only access + company scoping
