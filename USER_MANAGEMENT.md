# User Management Guide

This guide covers all four methods for managing employees in the performance management system, including the comprehensive employee archive system.

## üéØ Quick Start

### Method 1: Prisma Studio (Visual Interface)
```bash
yarn db:studio
```
- Opens browser at http://localhost:5555
- Point-and-click interface
- Perfect for quick edits and data viewing

### Method 2: CSV Import (Bulk Operations)
```bash
yarn db:import example-users.csv
```
- Best for adding many users at once
- Validates data and shows detailed results
- Handles manager relationships automatically

### Method 3: Server Actions (Programmatic Access)
```typescript
// Import from actions
import { createUser, updateUser, deleteUser, archiveUser, unarchiveUser } from '@/lib/actions/users'

// Create single user
const newUser = await createUser({
  name: "New User",
  email: "new@demo.com", 
  role: "employee",
  companyId: "company-id"
})
```

### Method 4: Employee Archive System (Enterprise Lifecycle Management)
```bash
# Access via web interface
Navigate to /users ‚Üí Uncheck "Active User" ‚Üí Provide reason ‚Üí Archive
Navigate to /users/archive ‚Üí View, search, restore, or permanently delete
```
- **Soft-delete approach**: Complete evaluation history preservation
- **Bilingual interface**: English/Spanish support with professional modals
- **Business rule protection**: Cannot archive active managers or self-archive
- **Dashboard integration**: Archived employees excluded from all statistics

## üìä CSV Import Format

Create a CSV file with these columns:

```csv
name,email,username,role,department,userType,password,employeeId,personID,managerPersonID,managerEmployeeId,companyCode
Michael Chen,michael.chen@demo.com,,manager,Engineering,office,password123,MGR001,87654321,,,DEMO_001
John Smith,john@company.com,,employee,Sales,office,password123,EMP001,12345678,87654321,,DEMO_001
Maria Worker,,maria.worker,employee,Manufacturing,operational,1234,EMP002,23456789,,MGR001,DEMO_001
HR Manager,hr1@demo.com,,hr,Human Resources,office,password123,HR001,11111111,,,DEMO_001
```

### Column Definitions:
- **name** (required): Full name
- **email**: For office workers (required if no username)
- **username**: For operational workers (required if no email)
- **role** (required): employee, manager, hr
- **department**: Team/department name
- **userType**: office (default) or operational
- **password** (required): Initial password
- **employeeId**: Company-assigned ID (EMP001, MGR001) for HRIS integration
- **personID**: National ID/C√©dula for legal identification (required for API import)
- **managerPersonID**: Manager's National ID for hierarchy matching (preferred)
- **managerEmployeeId**: Alternative manager matching via Employee ID
- **companyCode** (required): Company identifier

### Rules:
- Either email OR username is required
- Operational workers typically use username + PIN
- Office workers typically use email + password
- Manager relationships created via personID matching (managerPersonID)
- Alternative manager matching via employeeId (managerEmployeeId)
- personID and employeeId must be unique per company

## üîß Server Actions for User Management

### User Management Actions
```typescript
// Import the actions
import { createUser, updateUser, deleteUser } from '@/lib/actions/users'

// Get all users (via server component)
// In your page.tsx or component:
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: { companyId: session.user.companyId },
  include: { manager: true, company: true }
})

// Create user
const newUser = await createUser({
  name: "New Employee",
  email: "new@company.com",
  role: "employee",
  companyId: "clr123...",
  managerId: "clr456...",
  userType: "office",
  password: "password123",
  department: "Sales",
  employeeId: "EMP001",
  personID: "12345678"
})

// Update user
const updatedUser = await updateUser("user-id", {
  name: "Updated Name",
  department: "New Department",
  active: true
})

// Archive user (soft delete with evaluation history preservation)
await archiveUser("user-id", "Employee resigned")

// Unarchive user (restore to active status)
await unarchiveUser("user-id")

// Permanent delete (only for users without evaluation data)
await deleteUser("user-id")
```

### Available Admin REST APIs
```bash
# Get Companies (actual REST API)
GET /api/admin/companies
# Lists all companies with user counts

# CSV Import (actual REST API) 
POST /api/admin/import
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "companyId": "clr123...",
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "User 1",
      "email": "user1@demo.com",
      "role": "employee",
      "userType": "office",
      "password": "password123"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Employee Archive Management

### Archive System Overview

The Employee Archive System provides enterprise-grade employee lifecycle management with complete evaluation history preservation.

#### Key Features
- **Soft-delete approach**: Users marked as `active: false` instead of permanent deletion
- **Evaluation history preservation**: All performance data maintained during archive
- **Manager dependency validation**: Cannot archive managers with active direct reports  
- **Self-archiving protection**: Users cannot archive themselves
- **Bilingual interface**: Complete English/Spanish support
- **Dashboard integration**: Archived employees excluded from all statistics

#### Archive Workflow
1. **Archive**: Uncheck "Active User" in user management ‚Üí Optional reason ‚Üí Confirm
2. **View**: Navigate to `/users/archive` ‚Üí Search and filter archived employees  
3. **Restore**: Click restore button ‚Üí Employee returns to active status
4. **Delete**: Permanent deletion available only for users without evaluation data

### Archive Operations

#### Archive Employee
```typescript
// Via Server Action
import { archiveUser } from '@/lib/actions/users'

await archiveUser("user-id", "Employee resigned - end of contract")
```

#### View Archived Employees  
```typescript
// Database query for archived users
const archivedUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: { 
    companyId: "company-id",
    active: false 
  },
  include: {
    evaluationsReceived: true,
    manager: { select: { name: true, email: true } }
  }
})
```

#### Restore Employee
```typescript  
// Via Server Action
import { unarchiveUser } from '@/lib/actions/users'

await unarchiveUser("user-id")
```

#### Permanent Delete (Data-Free Users Only)
```typescript
// Only available for users with no evaluation history
import { deleteUser } from '@/lib/actions/users'

await deleteUser("user-id") // Bilingual confirmation modal required
```

### Archive Business Rules

#### Cannot Archive If:
- **Active Manager**: User manages active employees (must reassign or archive reports first)
- **Self-Archiving**: Users cannot archive themselves (system protection)
- **Missing Permissions**: Only HR users can perform archive operations

#### Data Preservation During Archive:
- **Evaluation History**: All received evaluations maintained
- **Manager Relationships**: Historical manager assignments preserved
- **Audit Trail**: Complete action history retained
- **Archive Metadata**: Timestamp, reason, and archiving user tracked

#### Dashboard Impact:
- **Statistics Excluded**: Archived employees removed from all counts and metrics
- **Query Filtering**: All dashboard queries enhanced with `WHERE active = true`
- **Historical Data**: Past evaluation data remains visible but user excluded from current reporting

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table with soft-delete fields
active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
archivedAt DATETIME NULL
archivedReason TEXT NULL  
archivedBy VARCHAR(255) NULL
```

#### Query Pattern
```typescript
// All user queries enhanced to exclude archived
const activeUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    companyId,
    active: true  // Critical filter for all active operations
  }
})
```

#### Manager Count Validation  
```typescript
// Enhanced employee count for archive validation
_count: {
  select: {
    employees: {
      where: { active: true }  // Only count active reports
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Office Employee
```typescript
import { createUser } from '@/lib/actions/users'

const newUser = await createUser({
  name: "Sarah Johnson",
  email: "sarah@company.com", 
  role: "employee",
  companyId: "clr123...",
  managerId: "clr456...",
  userType: "office",
  password: "password123",
  department: "Marketing"
})
```

### Scenario 2: New Operational Worker
```typescript
import { createUser } from '@/lib/actions/users'

const newWorker = await createUser({
  name: "Mike Rodriguez",
  username: "mike.production",
  role: "employee", 
  companyId: "clr123...",
  managerId: "clr456...",
  userType: "operational",
  password: "1234",
  department: "Manufacturing"
})
```

### Scenario 3: Employee Departure (Archive with History Preservation)
```typescript
import { archiveUser } from '@/lib/actions/users'

// Archive departing employee with reason
const archivedUser = await archiveUser("user-id", "Employee resigned - relocated to different city")

// Employee data preserved:
// - All evaluation history maintained  
// - Manager relationships preserved
// - Excluded from dashboard statistics
// - Can be restored if needed
```

### Scenario 4: Bulk Import from HR System
1. Export from HR system to CSV
2. Match columns to our format
3. Run: `yarn db:import hr-export.csv`

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Commands

```bash
# Open visual database editor
yarn db:studio

# Import users from CSV
yarn db:import path/to/users.csv

# Reset database and add demo data
yarn db:reset

# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
yarn db:generate

# Push schema changes to database
yarn db:push
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **User already exists**: Check email/username uniqueness per company
2. **Manager not found**: Ensure manager exists before creating employee
3. **Company not found**: Verify company code in CSV
4. **Invalid role**: Must be 'employee', 'manager', or 'hr'
5. **Cannot archive manager**: Manager has active direct reports - reassign or archive them first
6. **Archive button disabled**: Check if user is trying to self-archive (not allowed)
7. **Delete button missing**: User has evaluation data - only archive is available

### Debug Tips:
- Use Prisma Studio to verify data
- Check API responses for detailed error messages
- CSV import shows line-by-line results
- All operations are logged with detailed feedback

This system handles all your user management needs from quick edits to bulk operations and complete employee lifecycle management across 27 companies and 4000+ employees.
