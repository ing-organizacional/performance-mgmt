## üì± Key Features

### üåê Bilingual Interface (NEW!)
- **English/Spanish Support**: Complete translations for all interfaces
- **Instant Language Switching**: üá∫üá∏/üá™üá∏ toggle button in all pages  
- **Persistent Preference**: Language choice saved across sessions
- **Professional UX**: Native-language experience for bilingual workforces
- **Complete Coverage**: All text, forms, evaluations, and analytics translated

### Mobile-First Evaluation Interface
- **Progressive disclosure**: One decision per screen with fixed item card
- **Star rating system**: Intuitive 1-5 scale with auto-focus on comments
- **Unified evaluation**: OKRs (üéØ) and Competencies (‚≠ê) in single flow
- **Three-tier system**: Company/Department/Manager level items
- **Auto-save**: No data loss during evaluations
- **Thumb-friendly**: Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Universal access**: Works for HR, managers, and employees

### Evaluation Workflow (Three-Status System)
**Ridiculously Simple Flow:**
1. **`draft`** ‚Üí Manager creates and works on evaluation (default status)
2. **`submitted`** ‚Üí Manager completes ALL items (rating + comment) and submits for employee approval
   - Evaluation becomes **locked** from manager edits
   - Employee can view evaluation and approve it
3. **`completed`** ‚Üí Employee approves the evaluation (final status)

**Key Rules:**
- **Manager Accountability**: Cannot leave evaluations in `draft` forever (HR dashboard tracks overdue)
- **Employee Agency**: 3-day approval window, but stays `submitted` indefinitely if not approved (vacation flexibility)
- **Error Handling**: HR can "unlock" submitted evaluations back to `draft` if manager needs to fix errors
- **Completion Validation**: All OKR/competency items must have rating (1-5) AND comment before submission allowed
- **No Rejection Flow**: If employee doesn't approve, evaluation stays `submitted` - keeps it simple

**HR Dashboard Oversight:**
- **Overdue Drafts**: Shows `draft` evaluations past manager deadline
- **Pending Approvals**: Shows `submitted` evaluations awaiting employee action  
- **Overdue Approvals**: Shows `submitted` evaluations > 3 days for HR visibility

### HR Team Management (NEW!)
- **Dual-role support**: HR users can both manage teams and access admin functions
- **Team evaluations**: HR managers have their own direct reports to evaluate
- **Seamless navigation**: Dashboard ‚Üî Evaluations ‚Üî My Evaluations workflow
- **Real-time data**: Dynamic team summaries and completion tracking
- **Back navigation**: Easy return to dashboard from evaluation views

### Performance Cycle Management (NEW!)
- **Annual/Quarterly Cycles**: Create performance review periods with defined start/end dates
- **Status Control**: Active ‚Üí Closed ‚Üí Archived workflow with automatic enforcement
- **Read-Only Enforcement**: Managers cannot edit when cycles are closed
- **Partial Assessments**: HR can make individual item ratings with custom evaluation dates
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear status banners and cycle selectors throughout the UI
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of cycle operations and status changes

### Multi-Company Architecture
- **Data isolation**: Complete separation between companies
- **Scalable**: Handles 4000+ employees efficiently
- **Audit trail**: Complete change tracking
- **Role-based access**: HR, Manager, Employee permissions

### User Management (3 Methods)
1. **Visual Interface**: `yarn db:studio`
2. **CSV Import**: `yarn db:import users.csv`
3. **Server Actions**: `/src/lib/actions/users.ts`

## üìä Database Schema

```sql
-- Companies: Multi-tenant isolation
Company { id, name, code, active }

-- Users: Mixed workforce with HRIS integration identifiers
User { 
  id, companyId, name, email?, username?, role,
  passwordHash, pinCode?, userType, managerId,
  employeeId?, personID?, department?, shift?
}

-- Traditional Evaluations: JSON-based evaluation data with cycle association
Evaluation {
  id, employeeId, managerId, companyId, cycleId?,
  evaluationItemsData, overallRating,
  status, periodType, periodDate
  -- status: "draft" | "submitted" | "completed"
}

-- Structured Evaluation Items: Individual OKR/Competency definitions
EvaluationItem {
  id, companyId, cycleId?, title, description,
  type, level, createdBy, assignedTo?, active, sortOrder
}

-- Individual Item Assignments: Employee-specific item assignments
EvaluationItemAssignment {
  id, evaluationItemId, employeeId, assignedBy, companyId
}

-- Performance Cycles: Annual/quarterly review periods with status management
PerformanceCycle {
  id, companyId, name, startDate, endDate,
  status, closedBy?, closedAt?
}

-- Partial Assessments: Granular item tracking with evaluation date history
PartialAssessment {
  id, cycleId, employeeId, evaluationItemId,
  rating?, comment?, assessedBy, assessedAt,
  evaluationDate, assessmentType, isActive, companyId
}

-- AuditLog: Complete change tracking
AuditLog { id, evaluationId, userId, action, oldData, newData }
```

## üë• User Management

### CSV Import Format
```csv
name,email,username,role,department,userType,password,employeeId,personID,managerPersonID,managerEmployeeId,companyCode
Michael Chen,michael.chen@demo.com,,manager,Engineering,office,password123,MGR001,87654321,,,DEMO_001
John Smith,john@company.com,,employee,Sales,office,password123,EMP001,12345678,87654321,,DEMO_001
Maria Worker,,maria.worker,employee,Manufacturing,operational,1234,EMP002,23456789,,MGR001,DEMO_001
```

**Required Fields:**
- `name`: Full employee name (required)
- `role`: employee, manager, or hr (required) 
- `companyCode`: Company identifier (required)
- Either `email` OR `username` (at least one required)
- `personID`: National ID/C√©dula (required for API import, optional for CLI)

**Manager Assignment (choose one):**
- `managerPersonID`: Manager's National ID (preferred method)
- `managerEmployeeId`: Manager's Employee ID (alternative method)

**HRIS Integration Fields:**
- `employeeId`: Company-assigned ID (EMP001, MGR001) for HRIS integration
- `personID`: National ID/C√©dula for legal identification and unique identification
- `department`: Department/team name
- `userType`: office (default) or operational

### Server Actions Examples
```typescript
// User management via Server Actions (not REST APIs)
import { createUser, updateUser, deleteUser } from '@/lib/actions/users'

// Create user
const newUser = await createUser({
  name: "New User",
  email: "new@demo.com", 
  role: "employee",
  companyId: "company-id"
})

// Update user  
const updatedUser = await updateUser("user-id", {
  department: "New Department"
})

// Delete user
await deleteUser("user-id")
```

### Implementation Architecture
**Server Actions (Preferred):**
- Evaluation workflow uses Next.js Server Actions for form submissions
- Better type safety and progressive enhancement
- Located in `/src/lib/actions/` directory

**Available REST APIs (Legacy/Integration):**
```bash
# Import users from CSV
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/import \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"users": [{"name":"User","email":"user@demo.com"}]}'

# Get company data
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/companies
```
