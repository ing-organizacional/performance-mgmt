## 🗃️ Employee Archive System

**Complete employee lifecycle management** with evaluation history preservation and secure deletion capabilities.

### Archive Features

**Workflow**: Archive → View History → Restore or Permanent Delete

**Capabilities**: Soft-delete with data preservation, complete evaluation history retention, manager dependency validation, bilingual confirmation modals

**Safety Measures**: Cannot archive active managers, self-archiving protection, permanent delete confirmation for users without evaluation data

### Archive Management

**Archive Process**: Users marked as inactive (`active: false`) with timestamp and reason tracking

**Data Preservation**: All evaluation history, manager relationships, and audit trails maintained during archive

**Dashboard Integration**: Archived employees automatically excluded from all dashboard statistics and listings

### Archive Interface

**Location**: `/users/archive` - Dedicated archive management interface

**Features**: Search and filter archived employees, view complete evaluation history, restore to active status, permanent deletion for data-free users

**Access Control**: HR-only access with comprehensive bilingual support

### Technical Implementation

**Database Design**: Soft-delete pattern using `active` boolean field with archive metadata (timestamp, reason, manager snapshot)

**Query Filtering**: All active queries enhanced to exclude archived users (`WHERE active = true`)

**Bilingual UI**: Complete English/Spanish support with professional delete confirmation modals

### Usage

**Archive Employee**: Uncheck "Active User" checkbox in user management → Provide optional reason → Confirm archive

**View Archived**: Navigate to archive page → Search/filter → View evaluation history

**Restore Employee**: Click restore button → Employee returns to active status

**Permanent Delete**: Only available for users without evaluation data → Bilingual confirmation modal

### Safety & Compliance

**Business Rules**: Active managers cannot be archived until reports are reassigned, users cannot archive themselves, evaluation data is preserved during archive

**Audit Trail**: All archive/restore operations logged with user, timestamp, and reason

**Data Integrity**: Dashboard and statistics automatically exclude archived employees, ensuring accurate reporting
