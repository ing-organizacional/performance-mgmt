User { 
  id, companyId, name, email?, username?, role,
  passwordHash, pinCode?, userType, managerId
}

-- Evaluations: Unified evaluation items as JSON with cycle association
Evaluation {
  id, employeeId, managerId, companyId, cycleId?,
  evaluationItemsData, overallRating,
  status, periodType, periodDate
}

-- Performance Cycles: Annual/quarterly review periods
PerformanceCycle {
  id, companyId, name, startDate, endDate,
  status, closedBy?, closedAt?
}

PartialAssessment {
  id, cycleId, employeeId, evaluationItemId,
  rating?, comment?, assessedBy, assessedAt,
  evaluationDate, assessmentType, isActive
}

-- AuditLog: Complete change tracking
AuditLog { id, evaluationId, userId, action, oldData, newData }
```
